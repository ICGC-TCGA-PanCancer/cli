PANCANCER COMMAND LINE INTERFACE - INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------
This tool will setup a "launcher" host which has all of the tools we used to align and variant call
the PanCancer donors.  This launcher host can then launch one or more worker VMs with our Docker
workflows installed on them for processing one or more genomes specified by the user.

This system requires the following:
* Docker support in your Linux distribution (or boot2docker on a Mac)
* AWS credentials and/or OpenStack credentials
* A GNOS key (or keys) which are used to both download Docker images for our workflows, dependencies, as well as data from from GNOS servers used in the project
* Alternatively (or in addition to) the GNOS keys, a token for downloading workflows, dependencies, as well as donor data files from S3

DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE [Y/N]:
